# Youtube Downloader 

The script exists with a purpose of downloading multiple videos from youtube and store in a specific folder. Feel free to edit the script to satisfy your use.
I can not do this without the help of pytube package, please check their github also: https://github.com/pytube/pytube

Currently, the script only supports downloading mp3 files ( I have converted from mp4 to mp3 since pytube don't support that directly )

## Dependecies
1. [python](https://www.python.org/)
